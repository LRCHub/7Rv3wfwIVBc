How he knows where he's going -
Never lost -
No one, well there's no one faster
Direction born in his brain
He's got no reason to hide
He's got no laws to cross
He's got
Well he's got no master
Freedom born in his name
Aerie (3x)
Well you can't fly human master
No you can't fly - fly by yourself
You can't fly dying master
Without a rifle on your shelf
Aerie (3x)
